	  <h2>Bishop's History</h2>
		<p>
		Bishop James L. Dawson was baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ in February 1972.  Two weeks later he was filled with the Holy Ghost.  After being faithful and obedient to his natural and spiritual father, Bishop F. M. Dawson, he was ordained a Deacon at his local church, True Bible Way Church of Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith in Clarksdale, Mississippi.<br><br>
		He began working for the Lord as a Deacon.  From the very beginning, he had the support of his wife, Sister Mae Ella Dawson, and their nine children.  He, along with another faithful brother in the church, Deacon Johnny Campbell, began holding bible class from house to house, in the homes of Brother and Sister Walker, Sister Katherine Calvin and a few others.  They witnessed in Clarksdale, Vance, and in the Tutwiler, Mississippi areas.  The saints in these cities and towns wanted their family, friends, and neighbors witnessed to.  Many wouldn’t come to the church, so the church went to them.  Many lost souls were baptized, filled with the Holy Ghost, healed, delivered and set free.  He continued to be lead and taught by Bishop F. M. Dawson.  This Gospel of Jesus Christ was spread to many communities because of the work Deacon Dawson and the brethren were doing. <br><br>
		A family of saints, Brother and Sister Henry Reed and their children were living in the Wichita, Kansas area.  Bishop F.M. Dawson had served as Pastor to them when they lived in Tippo, Mississippi and continued the pastoral ship after they moved.  He visited, preached and taught them in their home.  In October, 1981, Deacon Dawson assisted his pastor by going to Wichita and holding bible classes and Sunday services for the saints there. <br><br>
		In November 1982, Deacon Dawson heeded the call to be a Minister.  He continued with the bible classes.  In Wichita, he continued to teach and minister to the people.  The congregation there grew.  Some saints from Clarksdale, Mississippi, moved to that area and began fellowship.  Classes were moved to a larger area, the Boston Center.  Later, they moved to a Marriott Hotel conference room, free of charge.  One of the saints, Mother Rosie Pearl Ellis’ son, J. C., worked there and was able to secure a conference room to use when bible classes and Sunday services were held. <br><br>
		God blessed mightily.  On July, 1984, Minister Dawson was ordained an Elder by the Bishop F. M. Dawson.  His ministry continued on course.   While conducting services in Wichita, he was still visiting the local churches with his pastor weekly. <br><br>
		He and Sister Dawson were considering the move to Wichita, Kansas.  Several of their children were already living there.  The move would be an easy transition.  One day, while looking for a particular department store, in Wichita, they got lost and ended up on Second Street, where they saw a church for sale.  Bishop F. M. Dawson had been looking for a church building for several months.  This church had a house that came as a packaged deal, next door to it.  They thought this would be the perfect place.  God had another plan for them.  They reported back to Bishop F. M. Dawson.  He approved, but only the church was purchased in 2002.  Elder Dawson continued to do the work of the Lord in Wichita and assisted the local surrounding areas. <br><br>
		When his father fell ill, he was very supportive; he carried on the work at the local churches and in Wichita.  The doors were held open and all church services at all the churches continued.  On July 13, 2003, at his father’s (the late Bishop F. M. Dawson) death, Elder Dawson became Pastor and Presiding Bishop and Overseer of the True Bible Way Church of Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith Organization.
		On September 27, 2003, at the 50th Annual Fall Convocation in Clarksdale, Mississippi, Bishop Willie G. Ball installed Elder James L. Dawson to Bishop James L. Dawson, Presiding Bishop and Overseer of the True Bible Way Church of Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith Organization. <br><br>
		Bishop James L. Dawson continues to hold true to the standards of holiness and this Apostolic Faith doctrine as it was taught to him by his father. Some of his father’s last words to him were “preach this gospel as I have preached it.  Do not deviate from this gospel.  Many people will come and say many things, but you stay with this gospel.” <br><br>
		He continues to hold fast the Word of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Many lost souls are still being fed and lead to Jesus Christ.
