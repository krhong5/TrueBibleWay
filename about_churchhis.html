	  <h2>Church History</h2>
		<p>In the year 1953, in a small beauty shop owned by Sister Clemmie Brown, in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the Bibleway Church began. Sister Brown,
		a dedicated member, gave Elder F.M. Dawson space to have church services. It started with only five members. They were Elder F.M. Dawson,
		Sister Willie Mae Dawson, Sister Clemmie Brown, and two other saints. Prior to that, services were held from place to place and house to house.
		Elder Dawson would go anywhere he was received to tell the good news of repentance, water baptism in Jesus’ name and being filled with the Holy Ghost. <br><br>
		The Church later moved to 60 17th street. Elder Dawson and the brothers got together and built a small 16x24 building. All of this took place in the first
		year. God poured out his blessings. Many lost were baptized, filled with the Holy Ghost, healed, delivered, and set free. In that same year, the Bible Way
		Church Organization was chartered. <br><br>
		The Lord showed Elder Dawson a vision in the sixties about another building He has for him. Elder Dawson said that one day he was walking near a cotton
		field near his home in Clarksdale and the Lord spoke to him and said, “This belongs to you”. He did not question God. <br><br>
		In the early 1970’s, God elevated Elder F. Dawson’s title to Bishop F.M. Dawson. <br><br>
		In 1976, the vision Bishop Dawson had in the sixties became reality. The church at 520 Hickory Street was purchased in the exact spot where God had
		showed him. Riverside Baptist Church was built on the property some years earlier. After a few years, they moved to another location. The local Head
		Start Program wanted to purchase the property, but due to the city’s building codes, they were unable to do so. The building remained vacant until
		God gave it to Bishop Dawson. That year the church named was changed from Bibleway Church to True Bible Way Church of Jesus Christ of the Apostolic
		Faith. The Church was renovated and the saints have remained at the same location. The property on the 17th Street was later sold. <br><br>
		Brother James Dawson was added to the body of Christ by baptism in Jesus name in February 1972. He was filled with the Holy Ghost two weeks later.
		After being faithful and obedient to his natural and spiritual father, Bishop F.M. Dawson, he was ordained a Deacon. <br><br>
		From the beginning, he had the support of his wife, Sister Mae Ella Dawson, and their nine children. He was along with another faithful brother
		in the church, Elder Johnny Campbell, began holdings bible class from house to house, in the homes of Brother and Sister Walker, Sister Katherine
		Calvin, and a few others. He continued to be led and taught by Bishop F.M. Dawson. This gospel of Jesus Christ was spread to many communities
		because of this work. <br><br>
		In November 1982, Deacon Dawson heeded the call to be a Minster. He continued with the bible classes. God blessed mightily. In July 1984, Bishop F.M.
		Dawson ordained Minster Dawson to an Elder. He continued to support his father by assisting him with the local churches and the church in Wichita,
		Kansas. <br><br>
		Elder and Sister Dawson considered the move to Wichita, Kansas. The move would be an easy transition. Several of their children already lived in the
		area. God had yet another plan for them. <br><br>
		Bishop F.M. Dawson fell ill. Elder Dawson continued to be supportive. He carried on the work with the local churches and the church in Wichita. <br><br>
		On July 14, 2003, God called His servant, Bishop Home to glory leaving his family, the saints, and his son in the gospel to carry on the work of the Lord. <br><br>
		On July 14, 2003, Elder James Dawson became the Overseer of The True Bible Way Church in Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith organization. <br><br>
		On September 27, 2003, at the 50th Annual Fall Convention in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the late Bishop Willie G. Ball installed Elder James Dawson
		as Bishop and Overseer of the True Bible Way Church in Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith Organization. <br><br>
		Bishop James Dawson continues on the work of the gospel of Christ. There continues to be growth. The church purchased a new 47-seat bus in 2007.
		In August 2008, a new Fellowship Hall was added, along with the street name changed from Hickory Street to F.M. Dawson Street. <br><br>
		Bishop James Dawson continues to hold true to the standards of holiness and this apostolic faith doctrine as his father taught it to him. His father’s
		last words to him were, “preach this gospel as I have preached it. Don’t deviate from this gospel. Many will come and say many things, but you stay with
		gospel”. <br><br>
		He continues to hold fast the words of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Many lost souls are being fed and led to Jesus Christ.
