		  <p>Our duty is to lift the fallen; visit the sick; strengthen the weak; encourage the faint-hearted; comfort the feeble-minded; 
			point the lost to the way of salvation and urge all believers to live a sanctified, 
			Holy Ghost filled life (Ephesians 5:18; Act 19: 1-6) and to prepare for the coming of the Lord Jesus (James 1:27; I Thessalonians 5:4, 
			Mark 16: 15-18; Matthew 25: 1-13). <BR /><BR />
			Moreover it is our indispensable duty, as partakes of the &quot;royal priesthood&quot; (I Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6; 5:10), to offer
			supplications, prayer, intercessions, and giving thanks for all men; for kings, presidents, governors, magistrates, and all that are in authority; 
			that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all Godliness and honesty; (I Timothy 2:14; Romans 13:1-14) and to 	submit ourselves "to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake",  
			whether it be king, as supreme, or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by Him for the punishment of the evil-	doers, and for the praise of them that do well, so long as these ordinances do not infringe upon the liberty of service towards God 
			according to the dictation of the heart or conscience. (See I Peter 2:13-17; Titus 3:1-12; Matthew 22:21).

		<div id="mission" class="w3-container abouts w3-card" >
			<p>The supreme mission of the church, and every individual believer, is to glorify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, 
			and to serve him forever (Ephesians 3:21; Romans 11:36; 1 Peter 4:11). He gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, 
			and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works; that we should shew forth the praises of Him who hath called us out of 
			darkness into His marvelous light; and that we may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked 
			and perverse generation, among whom we are as salt and as light that shine in the world,
			holding forth the Word of life, to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, 
			to guide their feet into the way of peace. (Titus 2:13, 14; I Peter 2:9; Philippians 2:15, Luke 1:79).

			<p>We Believe…that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, written by holy men of old as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.<br><br>
			We Believe…in one God who is eternal, infinite in power, holy in nature, attributes and purposes, as well as omniscient and omnipresent.<br><br>
			We Believe…that in Jesus dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, for it pleased the Father that in him should all the fullness dwell.<br><br>
			We Believe…in the virgin birth. Jesus was both human and Devine; He was God manifested in the flesh.<br><br>
			We Believe…in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br><br>
			We Believe…Open confession; repenting for the remission (removal) of our sins.<br><br>
			We Believe…in baptism in water by immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and in receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
			which is evidenced by speaking in other tongues as the Spirt of God gives utterance. 
			This constitutes the new birth according to Acts 2:38<br><br>
			We Believe…in presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god, which is a reasonable service. This mean living a holy and sanctified life.<br>
			We Believe…in Devine healing, communion and feet washing.<br><br>
			We Believe…God has an appointed time, wherein He shall judge the world, when everyone shall receive a just reward for the deeds done in the body: 
			the wicked shall go into everlasting punishment; the righteous saints, into everlasting life.

			Bishop James L. Dawson was baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ in February 1972.  Two weeks later he was filled with the Holy Ghost.  After being faithful and obedient to his natural and spiritual father, Bishop F. M. Dawson, he was ordained a Deacon at his local church, True Bible Way Church of Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith in Clarksdale, Mississippi.<br><br>
He began working for the Lord as a Deacon.  From the very beginning, he had the support of his wife, Sister Mae Ella Dawson, and their nine children.  He, along with another faithful brother in the church, Deacon Johnny Campbell, began holding bible class from house to house, in the homes of Brother and Sister Walker, Sister Katherine Calvin and a few others.  They witnessed in Clarksdale, Vance, and in the Tutwiler, Mississippi areas.  The saints in these cities and towns wanted their family, friends, and neighbors witnessed to.  Many wouldn’t come to the church, so the church went to them.  Many lost souls were baptized, filled with the Holy Ghost, healed, delivered and set free.  He continued to be lead and taught by Bishop F. M. Dawson.  This Gospel of Jesus Christ was spread to many communities because of the work Deacon Dawson and the brethren were doing. <br><br>
A family of saints, Brother and Sister Henry Reed and their children were living in the Wichita, Kansas area.  Bishop F.M. Dawson had served as Pastor to them when they lived in Tippo, Mississippi and continued the pastoral ship after they moved.  He visited, preached and taught them in their home.  In October, 1981, Deacon Dawson assisted his pastor by going to Wichita and holding bible classes and Sunday services for the saints there. <br><br>
In November 1982, Deacon Dawson heeded the call to be a Minister.  He continued with the bible classes.  In Wichita, he continued to teach and minister to the people.  The congregation there grew.  Some saints from Clarksdale, Mississippi, moved to that area and began fellowship.  Classes were moved to a larger area, the Boston Center.  Later, they moved to a Marriott Hotel conference room, free of charge.  One of the saints, Mother Rosie Pearl Ellis’ son, J. C., worked there and was able to secure a conference room to use when bible classes and Sunday services were held. <br><br>
God blessed mightily.  On July, 1984, Minister Dawson was ordained an Elder by the Bishop F. M. Dawson.  His ministry continued on course.   While conducting services in Wichita, he was still visiting the local churches with his pastor weekly. <br><br>
He and Sister Dawson were considering the move to Wichita, Kansas.  Several of their children were already living there.  The move would be an easy transition.  One day, while looking for a particular department store, in Wichita, they got lost and ended up on Second Street, where they saw a church for sale.  Bishop F. M. Dawson had been looking for a church building for several months.  This church had a house that came as a packaged deal, next door to it.  They thought this would be the perfect place.  God had another plan for them.  They reported back to Bishop F. M. Dawson.  He approved, but only the church was purchased in 2002.  Elder Dawson continued to do the work of the Lord in Wichita and assisted the local surrounding areas. <br><br>
When his father fell ill, he was very supportive; he carried on the work at the local churches and in Wichita.  The doors were held open and all church services at all the churches continued.  On July 13, 2003, at his father’s (the late Bishop F. M. Dawson) death, Elder Dawson became Pastor and Presiding Bishop and Overseer of the True Bible Way Church of Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith Organization.
On September 27, 2003, at the 50th Annual Fall Convocation in Clarksdale, Mississippi, Bishop Willie G. Ball installed Elder James L. Dawson to Bishop James L. Dawson, Presiding Bishop and Overseer of the True Bible Way Church of Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith Organization. <br><br>
Bishop James L. Dawson continues to hold true to the standards of holiness and this Apostolic Faith doctrine as it was taught to him by his father. Some of his father’s last words to him were “preach this gospel as I have preached it.  Do not deviate from this gospel.  Many people will come and say many things, but you stay with this gospel.” <br><br>
He continues to hold fast the Word of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Many lost souls are still being fed and lead to Jesus Christ.
