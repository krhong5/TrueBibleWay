				<h1>OUR BELIEFS OUR DUTY</h1>
					<p>Is to lift the fallen; visit the sick; strengthen the weak; encourage the faint-hearted; 
					comfort the feeble-minded; 
					point the lost to the way of salvation and urge all believers to live a sanctified, 
					Holy Ghost filled life (Ephesians 5:18; Act 19: 1-6) and to prepare for the coming of the Lord Jesus (James 1:27; I Thessalonians 5:4, Mark 16: 15-18; Matthew 25: 1-13). <BR /><BR />
					Moreover it is our indispensable duty, as partakes of the “royal priesthood” (I Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6; 5:10), to offer supplications, prayer, intercessions, and giving thanks for all men;
					for kings, presidents, governors, magistrates, and all that are in authority; 
					that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all Godliness and honesty; (I Timothy 2:14; Romans 13:1-14) and to submit ourselves "to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake",  
					whether it be king, as supreme, or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by Him for the punishment of the evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well, 
					so long as these ordinances do not infringe upon the liberty of service towards God according to the dictation of the heart or conscience. (See I Peter 2:13-17; Titus 3:1-12; Matthew 22:21).
					</p>
					
				<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
				<p>The supreme mission of the church, and every individual believer, is to glorify our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, 
				and to serve him forever (Ephesians 3:21; Romans 11:36; 1 Peter 4:11). 
				He gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, 
				and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;
				that we should shew forth the praises of Him who hath called us out of darkness into His marvelous light; 
				and that we may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, 
				in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom we are as salt and as light that shine in the world,
				holding forth the Word of life, to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, 
				to guide their feet into the way of peace. (Titus 2:13, 14; I Peter 2:9; Philippians 2:15, Luke 1:79).

			<h3>DOCTRINAL STATEMENT</h3>
			<p>We Believe… that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, written by holy men of old as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.<br>
			We Believe…in one God who is eternal, infinite in power, holy in nature, attributes and purposes, as well as omniscient and omnipresent.<br>
			We Believe… that in Jesus dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, for it pleased the Father that in him should all the fullness dwell.<br>
			We Believe…in the virgin birth. Jesus was both human and Devine; He was God manifested in the flesh.<br>
			We Believe…in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>
			We Believe…Open confession; repenting for the remission (removal) of our sins.<br>
			We Believe…in baptism in water by immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and in receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, 
			which is evidenced by speaking in other tongues as the Spirt of God gives utterance. 
			This constitutes the new birth according to Acts 2:38<br>
			We Believe…in presenting our bodies as a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god, which is a reasonable service. This mean living a holy and sanctified life.<br>
			We Believe…in Devine healing, communion and feet washing.<br>
			We Believe…God has an appointed time, wherein He shall judge the world, when everyone shall receive a just reward for the deeds done in the body: 
			the wicked shall go into everlasting punishment; the righteous saints, into everlasting life.
